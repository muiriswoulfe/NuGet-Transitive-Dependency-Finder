**The NuGet Transitive Dependency Finder analyzes .NET projects and solutions to
find superfluous dependencies that have been explicitly added to projects. The
goal is to simplify dependency management.**

.NET developers can use this application to find and remove these transitive
dependencies. This serves to simplify NuGet package upgrades by avoiding
conflicts between explicitly specified package dependencies and those
dependencies implicitly specified as part of a package dependency chain.

The solution comprises two projects for finding transitive dependencies:

- [`NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder`][codelibrary]. This project provides a .NET
  library that can be used in any application or service for finding transitive
  dependencies.
- [`NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.ConsoleApp`][codeconsoleapp]. This project
  runs the NuGet transitive dependency finder logic against a specified .NET
  project or solution. It is expected to be the standard mechanism through which
  consumers use the NuGet Transitive Dependency Finder.

It is not always possible to remove all transitive dependencies. Some transitive
dependencies are required to explicitly specify a dependency version different
from that included as part of a package dependency chain, in order to avoid
version conflicts. Therefore, removal of these transitive dependencies should be
performed iteratively to ascertain which can be removed without introducing
errors or warnings into your build process.

## Building

### Installing Dependencies

To build the NuGet Transitive Dependency Finder, you will need to install:

- [Git][git]
- [.NET Core SDK 5.0.101][netcoresdk] or later

You can simplify the process by also installing one of the following:

- [Visual Studio Code][vscode] with the [C# Extension][vscodecsharp]
- [Visual Studio][vs]

### Downloading the Code

The NuGet Transitive Dependency Finder is [hosted on GitHub][github]. You can
clone it directly using:

```Batchfile
git clone git@github.com:muiriswoulfe/NuGet-Transitive-Dependency-Finder.git
```

### Build Process

The easiest way to build the NuGet Transitive Dependency Finder is to open
[NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.sln][codesolution] in one of the following:

- [Visual Studio Code][vscode] with the [C# Extension][vscodecsharp]
- [Visual Studio][vs]

#### Visual Studio Code

1. Select *File* > *Open...*
1. Navigate to your local copy of
   [NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.sln][codesolution] and click *Open*.
1. Select *View* > *Command Palette...*
1. In the *Command Palette*, enter *Task: Run Build Task*.
1. In the next *Command Palette* view, enter *Build Debug* or *Build Release*
   depending on which configuration you wish to build. Most consumers should use
   the Release configuration.

#### Visual Studio

1. Select *File* > *Open* > *Project/Solution...*
1. Navigate to your local copy of
   [NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.sln][codesolution] and click *Open*.
1. In the toolbar, click the *Solution Configurations* dropdown to select the
   configuration you wish to build. Most consumers should use the Release
   configuration.
1. In the *Solution Explorer* window, right-click on the solution file and
   select *Build Solution*.

#### Command Line

To build directly from the command line, enter the command appropriate to which
configuration you wish to build:

```Batchfile
dotnet build --configuration NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.sln Debug
dotnet build --configuration NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.sln Release
```

Most consumers should use the Release configuration.

## Using

After building a copy of the solution or downloading a [release][releases], the
recommended procedure for running the NuGet Transitive Dependency Finder is to
enter the following sequence of commands, adapting the path to
`NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.ConsoleApp` as necessary:

```Batchfile
NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.ConsoleApp --projectOrSolution <ProjectOrSolutionToAnalyze> --all > before.txt
NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.ConsoleApp --projectOrSolution <ProjectOrSolutionToAnalyze>
```

`<ProjectOrSolutionToAnalyze>` should be replaced by the relative or absolute
path of the .NET project or solution you wish to analyze for transitive NuGet
dependencies. If you are using a local build rather than a release, you will
need to use `dotnet NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.ConsoleApp.dll` in place of
`NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.ConsoleApp`.

At this point you should remove all dependencies identified as transitive from
your projects. Ensure each project or solution continues to build, reinstating
any dependencies as appropriate.

Afterwards, enter the following sequence of commands:

```Batchfile
NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.ConsoleApp --projectOrSolution <ProjectOrSolutionToAnalyze> --all > after.txt
code --diff before.txt after.txt
```

The last command will open a copy of [Visual Studio Code][vscode], if available,
and highlight the differences between the full set of dependencies before and
after transitive dependency removal. To minimize the risk of a regression, the
only differences between the two files should be in the build process at the
start of the files and in the removal of those dependencies marked as
transitive. If there are additional differences, you can choose to reinstate
some appropriate dependencies and re-run the last set of commands to ensure this
has been remediated.

Note that ensuring the dependencies are identical before and after this process
is not strictly required. This step can be skipped depending on your risk
appetite and the level of validation that can be undertaken for your project or
solution.

### Extended Details

The basic mode of operation, which returns only the set of transitive
dependencies:

```Batchfile
NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.ConsoleApp --projectOrSolution <ProjectOrSolutionToAnalyze>
```

To view the entire collection of dependencies for each project, including both
transitive and non-transitive dependencies:

```Batchfile
NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.ConsoleApp --projectOrSolution <ProjectOrSolutionToAnalyze> --all
```

This mode is particularly useful for running before and after the removal of
transitive dependencies, as it can be used to detect if the removal of a
dependency resulted in the change of a different dependency's version. This can
occur because the removal of a transitive dependency results in the dependency
being pulled in from another dependency, and the version specified in that
dependency may differ from the one previously used. To avoid this and therefore
mitigate risk when removing transitive dependencies, you can run the NuGet
Transitive Dependency Finder in `--all` mode prior to removal and after removal
as per the recommended procedure above, to ascertain whether any dependencies
have changed version.

You can also view the full set of command-line options:

```Batchfile
NuGetTransitiveDependencyFinder.ConsoleApp --help
```
