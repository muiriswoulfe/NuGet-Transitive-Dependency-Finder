For help getting started or troubleshooting an issue, feel free to create a new
[Discussion][discussion].

If there is an unanswered question that you believe you can answer, your
contribution toward providing an answer would be much appreciated.

## Asking Quality Questions

Clearly frame your question and provide all relevant information. This makes it
easier for others to assist, and it makes it more likely that you will receive
the correct answer promptly. Spending time upfront can help save time in the
longer term.

When asking a question, try to define precisely what you need assistance with:

- Is there something you wish to do?
- Is there a problem that you are encountering? What steps have you taken in an
  attempt to resolve it?
- Is there a concept that you do not understand?

You should also consider:

- Searching to see if a similar question has already been asked.
- Learning about the [rubber duck debugging method][rubberduckdebugging].
- Learning about the [XY problem][xyproblem].
- If applicable, providing sample code and the output of any invocations of the
  application.
